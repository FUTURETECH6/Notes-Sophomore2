* To implement a binomial queue, <u>the subtrees of a binomial tree</u> are linked in <u>increasing</u> sizes. **False**
* <u> For potential method, a good potential function should always assume its **minimum** at the start of the sequence</u> **True**
* In an AVL tree, it is impossible to have this situation that the balance factors of **a** node and both of its children are all +1. **False**
* The difference between <u>aggregate</u> analysis and <u>accounting</u> method is that the later one assumes that the amortized costs of the operations may differ from each other. **True**
